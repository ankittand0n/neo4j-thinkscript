    {"title": "Chapter 7. Creating Strategies", "content": "At this very moment we presume that you are able to create a simple technical indicator as the most useful commands have been discussed in previous chapters. Let’s have a look at what this indicator could look like: This script will plot a 20 period SMA of Close price with both length and price adjustable via the input parameters. You can also add a declaration stating that this study should be displayed on the lower subgraph, define several variables to be used in calculations, call some tricky mathematical functions, and specify conditions which will provide you with trading signals. However, the main part here is the plot whose values are going to be analyzed. In this chapter we are going to discuss strategies – a different type of indicators which have trading signals as the main target of analysis. These indicators are displayed on the “Strategies” tab of “Edit Studies and Strategies” window and this is where they should be added. When you add a strategy to chart, Buy and Sell triggers appear in response to the specified conditions (and now you know a lot of ways to specify them; refer to and to refresh your knowledge). Strategies also provide you with ability to estimate the Profit/Loss value if you sent orders upon each Buy and Sell signal. This is what we call backtesting of a strategy: TOS Charts interface allows you to view the performance report upon clicking each signal on chart (the full procedure is described ). As one can expect, strategies are similar to regular studies, but they just have something special to them. This something is AddOrder function which (if properly used) will turn any technical indicator into trading strategy.  Now we are going to do it with the script above: Now it is a strategy which will add a Buy signal every time Close price crosses above its 20 period SMA and a Sell signal when it crosses below. Aside from the AddOrder function which will be discussed a bit later, we could notice a couple other differences peculiar to strategies. First of all, as you can see, this strategy does not have any plots (as the most studies do). This is characteristic of strategies: they do not normally show any plots, however, it won’t do any harm if you add a plot or several to this script. Secondly, defining the trading condition is crucial: in our case, it is price crossing above or below its SMA. But the main difference remains the same: the AddOrder function. Let us puzzle out its syntax: We called this function twice: first for the Buy signal and second for the Sell. In order to specify which side of trading is considered, AddOrder function requires an constant as the first argument. BUY_AUTO is a constant which AddOrder function uses to add a buying order for entering a new long position or closing a short one. Vice versa, SELL_AUTO is used to add a selling order for entering a new short position or closing a long position. As you can see, both BUY_AUTO and SELL_AUTO constants open new positions and close previous ones. If you prefer a constant which only opens or closes a position, consider using some of the other four: BUY_TO_CLOSE, BUY_TO_OPEN, SELL_TO_CLOSE, and SELL_TO_OPEN. While names of the constants speak for themselves, feel free to read more about them in our reference. The second argument of the function was the condition upon which the order of specified side and position effect will be added. This order will be added to the next bar after condition is fulfilled. When the strategy is applied to chart, each time the condition is fulfilled, an order is displayed. Orders are shown as up and down arrows above and below the price plot. These arrows are also accompanied by position effect, caption, and a tick marking the trading price. Appearance of these elements can be customized via the full syntax of the AddOrder function which is just a little bit more complicated than what you’ve seen before: Aside from previously described “type” and “condition”, arguments also include price, trade size, tick color, arrow color and name. Argument “price” defines price at which the order is added (by default, it is the Open of the following bar), “trade size” stands for the number of contracts traded; you can also specify colors for both tick and arrow. Colors need to be defined as constants, e.g., Color.RED, Color.GREEN, Color.ORANGE, etc. The full list of color constants can be found ; usage of these constants will be covered in the . The last argument is “name”; it defines the caption to be displayed (by default, it is the same as the name of the strategy itself). Now we are ready to make the strategy we created before look outstanding: Now this strategy opens the long position or closes the short one at the Open price of the next bar upon respective crossovers of Close price above and below its 20 period SMA. The trade size will be equal to 100, Buy signals will be colored yellow, Sell signals will be colored red, and each signal will display the trade side. After you added a strategy to chart, you can view the performance report by right-clicking any of the signals and choosing “Show report” from the menu. More information on the report can be found . Before we pass to the which will explain how to make your plots even more beautiful, here is an important notice about the strategies: all the signals you get are hypothetical, i.e., you cannot send real orders using strategies.

    {"title": "Chapter 8. Formatting Output: Part I", "content": "You might have noticed how good all the built-in studies look when applied to chart. But so far we only learned how to display plots as plain lines, except for where we gave you a hint on how to display a plot as Boolean points: This notation perfectly shows the common syntax for some of the functions. These functions will surely add the finished look to your plots. But first things first, let us study the syntax using the function from the script above as an example. Calling this function will command thinkScript® to change representation of the values from line to points or arrows or histogram or many other shapes. In the script above, we declared the “Crossover” plot – so, to change the way it is displayed, its name is going to be the first thing we type. After that, we put a dot and call the function by typing SetPaintingStrategy. And finally, we specify arguments for this function in parentheses; luckily, there is only one argument which happens to be a PaintingStrategy constant – and don’t forget the semicolon after the closing parenthesis. In the example above, we chose the Boolean points (with ) constant – it will put a dot at the Close price of those bars at which the crossover condition is true (i.e., where the 5 period SMA crosses the 20 period SMA). There are several other ways of representing Boolean values. Consider using BOOLEAN_ARROW_DOWN and BOOLEAN_ARROW_UP painting strategies. These can be especially useful in a script like this one: Now you will see an up arrow below those bars at which the shorter moving average crosses above the longer one and down arrow above those bars when it crosses below. There are also numerous ways to display the numerical plots. First of all, the line can be complemented with points, squares, or triangles which would definitely focus your attention on the values the line has at each bar (for this purpose, use LINE_VS_POINTS, LINE_VS_SQUARES, or LINE_VS_TRIANGLES). You can even discard the line and use only these basic shapes: POINTS, SQUARES, or TRIANGLES constants should be used then. Some values need to be represented as a histogram, use the HISTOGRAM constants for those. There are several other interesting painting strategies; the full list can be found . If you, however, prefer to keep the line, there are many options to make it look differently. For example, the function. Consider the following script: Now the EMA line will be displayed as a short-dashed curve. The function accepts constants, the full list and descriptions can be found . function is very simple to use: specify a number from 1 to 5 as an argument and it will define the width of the plot line in pixels: Sometimes there are situations where you need to hide a plot; there are two functions to help you with that: and . First function will hide the plot by default while the second will only hide it dynamically, i.e., upon some condition: In this example, plot plot is hidden by default and the is hidden on intraday charts only. In we promised to tell you more about colors that can be used when drawing plots. You can color plots using any of the following functions: , , or . is used to add a specific solid color to the whole plot. is used to draw the plot with different colors depending on specified conditions. is used to color the plot in the gradient manner depending on values. Before we move on to examples showing how to use these functions, let’s see how to specify which colors we will need. First way is to use a predefined Color constant, e.g, Color.RED (this is what we actually did in the previous chapter when assigning colors to strategy signals). Second way is to use functions and : the former draws the plot with colors named by the latter function. Another way is to use the function which accepts a number as an argument and returns the respective color from the palette; this palette can be found . For those who find our palettes insufficient, we have the function which accepts three numerical arguments used as RGB values in order to create whichever color you might think of. And finally, function will color the plot the same way as another plot; this is especially useful when colors of the plot change dynamically. Now that you are provided you with a whole lot of functions, let’s see how they work together: So, we started with drawing two bands of the Close price-based envelope: two bands shifted up and down by 10 percent from the band which is the Close price plot. After that, we used the function to define two named colors for the plot: and . The color is defined by this function using the Color constant: . In order to specify the value of color, we had the function translate RGB value (250, 150, 25) into argument of the function. After that we used the function to paint the in a solid color taken from the dynamic palette by the function – and made sure that would be colored the same (by using functions and ). And still the result was not colorful enough to us – so, we decided to add gradient coloring to the Middle plot with color for highest values and color for lowest ones. Of course, we do not expect you to use all these functions in a single script, however, you may try.  Also, if you feel tired of the plots, let’s move on to as there are several other ways to output values for you study.

    {"title": "Chapter 6. Human-Readable Syntax", "content": "While watching price action and indicators reach certain values and conform to certain conditions can provide valuable results, it is often more interesting to know when exactly values reached a notable threshold or trend began its development. A popular technique called double crossover method uses two moving averages with different lengths based on a premise that a Buy signal is produced when the shorter moving average crosses above the longer, Sell signal in the opposite situation. Many chartists use length of 5 for the short SMA and 20 for the long one. You are already able to compose a script checking whether the short SMA is above or below the long one: Just like you expect, this will plot a line on the lower subgraph with value of 1 when the shorter is above and 0 otherwise. But this is not  quite what the double crossover method implies: we need to know when exactly the shorter average crossed the longer one from below, i.e., it had been below for some time but started rising and finally went above. Human-readable syntax is here to help you: In this script, we used two reserved words: crosses and above. These are two human-readable commands which tell thinkScript® to check whether shorter average crossed above the long one. Just like it can be expected, the script producing Sell signals for the double crossover method will look like this: \"Above\" and \"below\" are additional statements to the main command \"crosses\" – they define the direction of crossovers we are interested in. If it doesn't matter to us if a line crosses another line from above or below and we only need to know the fact of the crossover itself, either of the two additional commands could be omitted: Now the lower subgraph will display a line with value of 1 for timestamps where crossovers happen and zero otherwise. Moving just a little bit forward: this kind of representation might seem not very convenient and, although output formatting will be discussed in and , consider using the following script to display the crossovers as dots at the bars where they take place: Human-readable syntax is not restricted to crossover identification. Full vocabulary of commands can be found . A number of sentences can be constructed using this vocabulary in order to define logical expressions, e.g., This looks more like a text than a script, doesn't it? However, it will work: condition1 will check if bars have equal Open and Close price, condition2 will define bars whose Close price is greater than its 9 period SMA, and condition3 will identify bars for which neither of the two is true. Human-readable syntax can also be helpful to beginners when they need to use a past value of data (this is what we call 'referencing historical data' which is going to be fully described in ). For example, if you need to identify bars whose Close price is greater than its previous value, use this script: Here, we used expression \"from 1 bar ago\" (which could be easily transformed to \"from 2 bars ago\", \"from 20 bars ago\", \"from 77 bars ago\" – whichever you prefer), and the result will be displayed as the line with values of 1 and 0. Again, for those who don't like the line representation, the Boolean points can be used: feel free to experiment with the function we revealed before. Another interesting command is \"within\": it is used to check whether some condition was true at least once for any of the last several bars. So, we could expand a bit the previous script: Now this script is going to work differently: the line will have value of 1 if the condition is true in at least one of the last three bars. Now that we have learned many ways of specifying conditions which will possibly yield some valuable trading signals, we could test them by constructing a strategy to put these signals on chart and estimate the Profit/Loss value.

    {"title": "Chapter 5. Conditional Expressions", "content": "So far, we have discussed functions which process price data and yield some output to be considered by chartists. However, few will argue that technical analysis is all about analyzing if data provided by studies or the price data itself conform to certain conditions. For example, there is a huge block of technical indicators called which is entirely built on conditions whether certain candles have certain shape, color and position. There are also less exotic examples of employing conditions in analysis: , for instance, is believed to indicate strong trend upon a condition that its value is higher than 100. Just like many other programming languages, thinkScript® offers users the standard if-then-else scheme, however, there are several ways to employ it in script. First of all, let’s discuss usage of if-expressions and if-statements in thinkScript®. Consider the following script: This script uses an if-expression to calculate SMA of Close price: if long_average input is set to “yes”, its period will be equal to 26; if it is set to \"no\", 12 period SMA will be calculated. If-expression is a simple way to assign one of the two possible values to an input parameter, but what should we do if we need to change the function itself? For example, we might want to use an EMA instead of SMA if the input is set to “no”. Here comes the if-statement which has a different syntax but keeps quite the same meaning: Depending on whether or not long_average input is set to “yes”, this script will plot either 26 period SMA or 12 period EMA of Close price. Note how this script declares the plot and the math behind it: command precedes the if-statement. Using the if-statement is helpful when you need some serious mathematic calculation and keeping it in a single line of code could be very confusing. When you however need a simple switch like in the example above, the if-expression will do: In , we discussed assigning Boolean values to a variable with this example: Once this variable outputs Boolean values 1 or 0 (“yes” or “no”), we could use this variable as a condition for the if-expression: This script will plot a line connecting the higher of Close and Open for each bar. This can be also achieved using the third type of conditional expressions: if-function. The if-function is, perhaps, the simplest way of defining a condition when you just need to specify numerical true and false values. The syntax of this function is trivial: you just specify the condition, true value and false value as input parameters; true value will be returned if the condition is fulfilled and false value will be returned otherwise. See how the Maximum plot from the example above can be constructed using the if-function: As it was stated before, only numerical data can be specified as true and false values. If you, however, need a certain constant (e.g., ) or a string value, the if-expression should be used. Let’s see all the three ways to specify conditions in a single script: Here, plot Maximum1 is defined by if-function, Maximum2 by if-expression, and Maximum3 by if-statement, all the three plotting the higher of Open and Close prices. Use the function for simple conditions with numerical true and false values, the expression for numerical or non-numerical ones, and if-statement for beautification of complex formulas you might need when creating indicators. In this chapter we only discussed simple comparison operators yielding Boolean values to form conditional expressions. However in thinkScript®, there are several more interesting logical operators which can be set using human-readable syntax. This kind of syntax will be explained in the .

    {"title": "Chapter 9. Formatting Output: Part II", "content": "Some time ago, plots were mandatory for thinkScript® studies. If someone tried adding a study without any plots, they saw an error message: \"At least one plot should be declared\". Well, now it is not an error message any more: it is just a friendly reminder as, for most of the studies, plots are still expected. For most, but not for all: let's see how to replace plots with some of the Look and Feel functions. Let's start with function . This function adds a nice little label to the upper left corner of chart. This label indicates whichever data you prefer: This label will display word \"Uptrend\" if Close price is greater than its 20 period SMA and \"Downtrend\" otherwise. First argument of this function is a condition upon which the label is displayed; here, we used word for the label to be always visible. We also specified a condition ( ) which will select either word \"Uptrend\" or \"Downtrend\" to be shown, however, you might want to display some calculated value without any conditions: Now the label will display value of the SMA itself. You can also add a short explanation of what is being displayed by using the following notation: Here we specified the text to be displayed and concatenated it with the value of the average using the sign \"+\". There is also another way to concatenate some values in a string, which is the function, but we advise that you use the plus sign as it is much more convenient. And, of course, we could not leave you without an option to choose the color of the label. By default, it is displayed red, but let's make it dark orange: We used the simplest way, the Color constant, but you are free to color the label using techniques described in . For example, let's make it chartreuse green (RGB value:  127,255,0 ): Now you are displaying this label with a color which is the most visible to human eye. Feel free to experiment with other colors. Also, you can add some dynamic coloring: This script will display 20 period SMA of Close price in a green label if Close price is greater than this average, or in a red label when the Close price is lower. To sum it up, three arguments can be used for function. These arguments are: condition upon which the label is visible (state to make it always visible), text and values to be displayed (specify text in quotes and use the \"+\" sign to concatenate it with a value), and color which is red by default. Another way to output values is showing bubbles at price bars. This is done by using function: This script will display chart bubbles at bars where Close price crosses above its 20 period SMA. Bubbles will be displayed at Close price of these bars (this is what the second argument, , stands for) with default color (red). By default, bubbles are located above the price plot; if you would like to display them below, transform this script into: Here, we explicitly set the value of the last argument to . So far, we customized each function in such a way where all the arguments change their default values. This is a perfect example of what should be done if you are fine with some of the arguments' default values but would like to change those of others: you specify the name of the argument and assign a value to it with the 'equals' sign. Name of each argument of each function can be found in thinkScript® Reference. For function, the following arguments can be used: (condition upon which the bubble is displayed), (price at which the bubble is shown), (information to be displayed in the bubble), (use a color constant or a color-related function), and (defines whether the bubble should be displayed above the price plot). When a bubble is not enough to draw attention to some price action, you can add a vertical line with some text. Function is used for this purpose: This script will mark the same bars as the previous did, but the vertical lines will be displayed instead of bubbles. Arguments for the function are: (identical to argument of ), (has the same application as the two previously described functions), (all the same, again), and (the style of the line to be displayed, set with constants). The last but not the least, function is a nice way to avoid several plots when you only need difference in their values. This function visualizes the difference between two calculated values by filling area between them with a translucent color: This script is another visualization of the previously mentioned double crossover method. We have two SMAs of the Close price: 5 period and 20 period. function visualizes difference between them in the following way: those sections where the shorter average is greater are colored pink and those where the longer is greater, blue. Remember not to swap the arguments as this function compares the first argument to the second and colors the mentioned sections in respective colors.

    {"title": "Chapter 10. Referencing Historical Data", "content": "In , we discussed how to use some past data in technical indicators, that is when you need a previous value of a variable or function when calculating those for the current bar. For example, returns the Close price of the second last bar, returns the Close price of the bar prior to the current, etc. What we did not discuss is how to move back to the future, i.e., use values of following bars in calculations which is also possible. Negative numbers are here to help: these refer to the future data. For example, ago returns the Close price one bar forward, returns the Low price two bars forward, etc. This might look awkward but it will surely work. Using human-readable syntax for referring to historical data only deems possible when some simple math is employed, e.g., This script will plot the sum of the Close price 4 bars ago and the High price 1 bar ago. But what should we do if we need lots of past and future data to perform numerous mathematical operations on? There was actually a hint for that in when we declared recursive variables. The following script was discussed there: This script calculates cumulative volume starting from the first bar on chart. The square brackets next to contain an index which tells thinkScript® how many bars before the current was the one whose value we need. Just like with the human-readable syntax, positive indexes are used to refer to data in the past and negative indexes refer to data in the future. For example, close[1] returns the Close price of the previous bar, close[2] returns the second last, etc. At the same time, close[-1] returns the Close of the next bar (of course, if there are any), close[-2] returns the Close price 2 bars forward, etc. The example will plot the difference between the current Close price and the Close price 5 bars ago. Historical data is ubiquitously used in built-in studies and strategies. This is especially important when you need recursive variables as they need their previous values to be declared. A good example of recursively declared variables is Fibonacci sequence: each number in it is equal to the sum of previous to with first numbers being 1 and 1. Here is a script for that: Here we used the function which has a very interesting calculation mechanism. First of all, let’s see what its arguments are: So, being used to initialize studies with recursion, this function calculates a compound value according to following rule: if number of a bar is greater than then the value is returned, otherwise it returns the value. In our Fibonacci sequence script, it assigned value of one to the first two bars (using 2 as the value of parameter ), and, starting from the third bar, each following number is calculated as the sum of the previous two. As a result, we get a plot with values of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on. Now that you’ve learned to move backward and forward all across the chart, let’s move on to discussing aggregation periods which actually form the bars on time charts.

    {"title": "Chapter 4. Using Averages", "content": "The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is basically the arithmetic mean of preceding prices on a specified time period. Being ubiquitous in technical analysis, it is the simplest tool for trend determination. In thinkScript®, this type of moving average can be calculated by calling function with the following syntax: This will calculate the Simple Moving Average of Close price over last nine bars. Note that just like all the other averages, SMA has a default value for period on which it should be calculated: for this type of average it is equal to 12. In other words, if you omitted the 9 in the script above and just typed The 12 period SMA of Close price would be calculated. Compared to other averages, SMA assigns equal weight to each day’s price which, by some chartists, is believed not quite correct: according to them, heavier weight should be given to the more recent data. In order to eliminate this problem, Weighted Moving Average (WMA) was designed: this type of average artificially assigns weight to prior prices by using specific coefficient when calculating the mean value. To calculate the WMA, thinkScript® multiplies each prior price on the specified period by weight factor equal to sequence number of its bar on the specified period and then the total sum of these values is divided by the sum of multipliers. Therefore, most weight is given to the current bar and least to the first one. Here is the syntax of function: This script will calculate the 10 period WMA of the Open price. If 10 is omitted, the default value of 9 will be used for the length parameter. While WMA corrects SMA’s weighting problem, both averages share another disadvantage: their calculation suggests that the oldest value on the period be removed when passing to the following bar which means that only most recent data is taken into consideration. These issues are addressed by Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Giving more weight to the more recent data, the Exponential Moving Average, however, does not completely eliminate price action prior to the calculation period. This is possible because EMA uses a different calculation mechanism than the SMA does. Here is the formula: where p is the price of the last bar, p is the price of the previous bar, and so on, and α is a smoothing coefficient calculated as follows: where N is equal to . EMA smoothing is applied to data by calling the function: This script will plot EMA of the High price with length equal to 9 which makes the smoothing coefficient equal to 20%. ExpAverage has 12 as the default value for the length parameter. Another method of assigning weights while keeping older data is Wilder’s Average. Its calculation is similar to that of EMA except it uses SMA instead of the price itself as the last term in total sum of prices. Also, in Wilder’s Average, the smoothing coefficient α is equal to 1/N. To use the Wilder’s Average, the following script is suggested: This script will plot Wilder’s Average of the Low price with length equal to 20 which makes the smoothing coefficient equal to 5%. Just like SMA and EMA, WildersAverage has 12 as the default value for the length parameter. In thinkScript®, there is also a generalized function which is able to return all kinds of the mentioned moving averages (and also, the ): . However, using this function is a bit more complicated as it accepts constants as input parameters. Consider the following script: This script will plot 12 period SMA of Close price; however, once added on chart, this study will be able to change the type of average via Edit Studies and Strategies window: input “average type” will allow you to select Weighted, Exponential, Wilder’s, or Hull average instead of the Simple one. This script is also a good example of how constants look in thinkScript®: notation of a constant has two parts separated by a dot where the first part shows constant’s family and the second one is its name. For example, other constants of the AverageType family are: The full list of constants and families they belong to can be found .

    {"title": "Appendix D. Using NaN and Infinity Constants", "content": "Ever since we published this set of tutorials, we have been receiving questions from fellow thinkScripters demanding more in-depth info on certain constructions in our programming language. This was a pleasure to know that our users look though the scripts of pre-defined studies in order to employ more advanced constructions, which, of course, made them wonder what certain things were. In this article, we're going to discuss a subject that was briefly mentioned in : the type constants. What you already know is that and stand for mathematical numbers e and pi, respectively. The most curious, though, have noticed that there are three other constants in thinkScript that are used everywhere throughout studies: , , and . While they are obviously harder to get and their purpose might seem obscure, they're not really secret combos; let's see what they are and how you may use them in your scripts. First of all, NaN here stands for \"not a number\". Basically speaking, this constant represents a value that cannot be plotted because it doesn't exist for some reason. Several examples of when it happens: 1. OHLC values of the current symbol are NaN when a script tries to retrieve them from the time point before IPO or before the first visible bar on tick and range charts. The same happens when the script tries to retrieve OHLC values from the right expansion of the chart (i.e., from the time point in the \"future\", which doesn't have any OHLC values yet). 2. OHLC values of the secondary symbol are NaN when there is a gap in the chart data. Consider the following script: On an intraday /ES chart, values of price are NaN when there are no quotes for SPX. 3. Results of errors, where the expression has no mathematical sense, e.g.: ; ; . Not being a number, is still a constant, so it's possible to use it in some expressions. However, its usage is somewhat specific: 1. When you use a in an if-expression, the result is also NaN, no matter what is stated in the then-else branches. For example, the following script (which could have been supposed to check for \"not-a-number\" situations on chart): will not plot anything because its output is always NaN and thus cannot be plotted. In order to check that close is NaN, the function can be used: 2. NaN plus any number is not a number. This is important for recursive variables: if at some point of recursion the variable becomes NaN, all its further values will be NaN as well. In order to avoid that, use the function. 3. The function can help you fill chart gaps with certain values. Consider the following script: This script plots the close price of IBM without gaps. Any possible gap in the plot is replaced with the last known value of close before it. Checking for gaps or not existing values is not the only application of the NaN concept. It may also be applied in scripts where you need to plot something for certain bars and nothing for others. Consider the following script: This script detects three last bars by checking that there's nothing after them. It plots the last bar's close price across these three bars and nothing for other bars and the right expansion. These two constants were added for those who can't imagine scripting without dividing by zero. The is the thinkScript representation of dividing any positive number by zero and the is its negative counterpart. They represent respectively the positive and the negative values of infinitely large magnitude. While the whole concept of infinite values might seem esoteric, they can be successfully employed in your scripts. Consider the following examples. Here is a sophisticated way of plotting the smallest non-zero high-to-low range on chart: This plot replaces zero range values with infinitely large, which makes it possible to detect the smallest value. In , we discussed a function called ; this function visualizes the difference between two calculated values (variables or plots) by filling the area between them with a translucent color. Infinity bounds though may trick it into displaying something more impressive: Assigning infinite values to a variable will have the function display infinite stripes and paint them corresponding to a rule. In our case, the stripes where the close price is greater than or equal to its average will be painted green and the others will be painted red. The chart will not be re-scaled because infinity values are not plotted. Consider the script below: This script finds the greatest of several recent values of price, with a non-constant number of values being processed. This approach was used in the implementation of the study.

    {"title": "Chapter 1. Defining Variables", "content": "In thinkScript®, variables are declared using reserved word . Syntax of the declaration is quite simple: first, you type , which will state that you are going to declare a variable, then you specify the name of the variable so that thinkScript® recognizes it, add the “equals” sign (=) to determine how the variable is going to be calculated, proceed with expression showing how to calculate it, and don’t forget to terminate the line with semicolon to let thinkScript® know that the calculation is over. Here is an example of the most basic script: This script will retrieve the Close price for each bar. Was it too simple for you? Let’s make it a little bit more complex: Now this script will calculate the midpoint of each bar. Note, however, that we already have a built-in function for calculation of this value, it is called . Thus, the following script will calculate the same value: A more interesting thing is that you can use logical expressions to declare a variable so that the latter has Boolean values. It is useful when you like to check if some condition is true for some bar: In this script, variable will have value of 1 for those bars having Close price greater than 700 and 0 for all others. Note that Boolean values are translated into numerical. In other words, you can perform arithmetical operations on them. Consider the following script: In this script, variable will have value of 3 for those bars having Close price higher than 1100, 2 for bars with Close price in between 900 and 1100, 1 for those closing in between 700 and 900, and 0 for the rest. This script is also a good example of using multiple variables: once you have declared a variable, you are free to use it further on. Variables can be declared recursively, so that they use their own values in further calculation. Let’s start with a basic example: This script calculates cumulative volume starting from the first bar on chart. The logic behind it is quite simple: before the calculation, thinkScript® assigns 0 to the variable (it actually always does so), thus, its value at the first bar will be equal to volume. Then, for the second bar, it takes previous value and adds current volume to it; accumulation of volume proceeds until the last bar on chart. You must have noticed square brackets next to in the script. These brackets have thinkScript® take a certain value from the previous bar; we will study this notation more thoroughly in , however, keep in mind that these square brackets indicate historical reference. Once you declare all the variables, you might want to display results of calculation on chart. This is done by using the reserved word . This word commands thinkScript® to visualize values of a variable using numerous graphical instruments. In this chapter we will focus on the default one which happens to be line. This painting strategy connects points derived from calculation in the manner of a broken line; here is an example script: This script will plot the ratio of Close+Open to High+Low. Note that reserved word replaces , and we could actually plot the same value using a single line of script: However, this is not the case when you need some serious calculations using complicated mathematics. Note that the value will be plotted on upper (price) subgraph, however, you are free to choose another subgraph on which the plot will be displayed; use reserved word for this purpose. This should be the first line in the script, study the example: The previously discussed value will be plotted on lower subgraph. In order to plot values on volume subgraph, use command in the same way. For information on other ways of placing plots on chart, see the page of thinkScript® reference. Now that you are keen on thinkScript® variables, let’s move on to arithmetical operations you might want to perform on them; these operations will be discussed in the .

    {"title": "Overview", "content": "It’s no surprise that there were times when technical analysts did not have computers to apply newly designed techniques to charts. Nowadays, we are able to create complex technical indicators and strategies using data one could not even imagine back in the time. Users of platform are provided with a powerful and flexible tool called thinkScript® language. This embedded programming language allows you to add your own studies and strategies to more than 300 built-in ones (or even reference their values in your own scripts). What you are going to read here is a set of tutorials which will get you acquainted with this powerful tool. These tutorials are not going to teach you how to trade, moreover, we presume that you already know how the charts are constructed and what, for example, the High, Low, Open and Close values are. The purpose of these tutorials is to describe the most useful tools of thinkScript®, should it be variables, functions, or plots – all of those will help you construct your perfect technical indicators. To start scripting, you will need to open the Editor window: this is where you type your script which is checked and parsed by the application and, if everything is correct (we are sure it will be if you read these tutorials), added to chart as a study or strategy.

It’s no surprise that there were times when technical analysts did not have computers to apply newly designed techniques to charts. Nowadays, we are able to create complex technical indicators and strategies using data one could not even imagine back in the time. Users of platform are provided with a powerful and flexible tool called thinkScript® language. This embedded programming language allows you to add your own studies and strategies to more than 300 built-in ones (or even reference their values in your own scripts). What you are going to read here is a set of tutorials which will get you acquainted with this powerful tool. These tutorials are not going to teach you how to trade, moreover, we presume that you already know how the charts are constructed and what, for example, the High, Low, Open and Close values are. The purpose of these tutorials is to describe the most useful tools of thinkScript®, should it be variables, functions, or plots – all of those will help you construct your perfect technical indicators. To start scripting, you will need to open the Editor window: this is where you type your script which is checked and parsed by the application and, if everything is correct (we are sure it will be if you read these tutorials), added to chart as a study or strategy.

    {"title": "Chapter 3. Defining Inputs", "content": "In this chapter we will discuss how to make your study more flexible. Most of the built-in studies are adjustable in terms of timeframe, price data, or mode of calculation to employ. It is only a matter of seconds to switch from a larger timeframe to a shorter one using input parameters which will appear in your Edit Studies and Strategies dialog window if you properly use reserved word in the beginning of the script. Let’s see how it works. In , the following script was discussed: Now that you know that the variables and will yield identical values, let’s exclude the latter from the script: Here is the question: what if you don’t need the Close to Open ratio anymore but need the inverse one? What if you don’t need this one either and want the High to Low ratio instead? Here is the best way to do it: Once added, this script will provide the same results as the above mentioned would. But this one is much better: whenever you need to change the ratio, you could go to the Edit Studies and Strategies dialog window and build this ratio directly in it. In order to do that, specify the fundamentals for and and click ; the script will be recalculated. You are not restricted to only using the price data for inputs: thinkScript® provides you with numerous types of inputs, automatically deciding which type it would be based on the default value specified by you (this is what you type after the equals sign in the input declaration row). Integer inputs will allow you to enter another integer with which the calculation will be performed. This will calculate a 10 period SMA of close price (if you are not sure what it is, will explain everything) with an option to change its length via the corresponding input. And, of course, we could make it even more flexible: Now both price and length can be adjusted. Floating numbers can also be used for inputs, however, be careful as there are types of data for which only integers can be used, e.g., number of bars. In order to tell thinkScript® that you need a floating number, use a period in the default value: This script will draw an envelope based on the Close price. In this envelope, bands will be shifted up and down from the close price by 10 percent, although you are free to specify any percentage you need: 25.5, 47.8, 99.9, etc. Using a string input can be especially useful when you need a quick change of symbol for which some value is calculated: This plot draws the Close price of the specified symbol which is set to “SPX” by default. Note that string inputs are defined using values in quotes. Symbols are not the only application of string inputs as this type of input can be used for any function that accepts string values as input parameters. Boolean inputs can quickly help you select a certain calculation mode out of two defined in the script: to define a Boolean input, use or as the default value: This script will plot a channel based on the highest High and lowest Low price on the period of 10 bars if the input is set to . If this input is set to , channel we be plotted based on the highest and lowest Close price. Note that we use an explicit condition in this script: it starts with word and tests if we chose or as the input value. Using conditional expressions will be discussed in . If you need more than two options to select from or if you prefer more meaningful naming for them, the type should be used. This will require just a little bit more scripting, but it’s not too difficult. First of all, list all the options for the input in braces and specify the default one: After that, you will need to specify what should happen if a certain option is selected. This is done by using commands and : This example script plots the volume oscillator, a difference between two simple moving averages (SMAs) of volume with different lengths. Here, command defines whether the oscillator should be plotted as the difference itself ( points) or as its percent ratio to the slower moving average ( percent).

    {"title": "Chapter 2. Mathematical Functions", "content": "While discussing variables, we already used the simplest mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations do not require any special notation and can be performed using basic characters: plus (+), minus (-), asterisk (*), and slash(/), respectively. Also, declaration of Boolean variables often implies using comparison operators: greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equals to (>=), less than or equals to (<=), etc. There are also equality operators falling into the same group. To test if two values are equal, use the double sign (==). For the inequality, use either '!=' or '<>' signs. Here is an example script for using equality/inequality operators: Variables b and c are identical: they will both have values of 0 for bars closing at the Open price (sometimes called candles) and 1 for the rest; values of variable a will be vice versa. The full list of comparison operators can be found ; don't be surprised when you see that thinkScript® accepts some English words as operators, this will be thoroughly explained in . For more complex calculations you might need some of thinkScript® functions. Let's start with power-related ones. These functions allow you to raise a value to a power, or find an exponential value or a logarithm.  Study the following script: This script calculates six data values based on the initial value of the Close to Open ratio for each bar. calculates the square of this value with . returns the square root using function. uses function to raise the value to the power of 3. calls the to raise Euler's number to the power of the value. returns the common logarithm of the value and , the natural logarithm; functions and are used for these purposes, respectively. Let's study the syntax of calling functions in thinkScript®: first, you type the name of the function, then you specify its arguments in parentheses and terminate the line with semicolon. If a function requires several arguments, they need to be separated with a comma – see how it works with variable in the example above. Function requires two arguments: value to be raised (in our case, it is variable ) and the power to raise this value to (we used 3 in the example). When working with power-related functions, you might want to use the Euler's number. There is a built-in constant in thinkScript® for this purpose: . Word in its name has nothing to do with multiplying by 2: it is just a common thinkScript® designation of floating-number data type. See how to use this constant in the following script: Variables and will always return identical values as they both raise Euler's number ( ) to the power of . Next set of functions we are going to discuss is trigonometric. It consists of six functions: and . All of these use a single argument for which the value will be returned. Note that functions and use arguments expressed in radians so that constant might be useful. Functions and return values in radians; for details, see the corresponding articles in thinkScript® reference. thinkScript® also provides you with a number of functions which round values if for some reason fractions or irrational numbers are not desired. These functions are: and . Here is an example: In this script, Euler's number is rounded using five different algorithms, thus the results will be different. uses the function rounding the number to the closest integer which is not less than the number itself; the result is 3. uses the function which also rounds the number to the integer, however, this integer must not be greater than the number rounded, so the result is 2. Functions and reduce the length of the value to the specified number of digits after the decimal point (for this purpose we specified the second argument in parentheses, 3). While function rounds the number to the greater one, does towards zero, and to whichever is closer. So, in the example above, will be equal to 2.719 while both and will be equal to 2.718. However, if you round the values to four decimal places (using (Double.E, 4) as the arguments), and will be both equal 2.7183 and will be equal to 2.7182. The full list of available functions with detailed descriptions can be found in the section of thinkScript® reference, so feel free to research those in order to apply some complex math to your scripts if needed.

While discussing variables, we already used the simplest mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations do not require any special notation and can be performed using basic characters: plus (+), minus (-), asterisk (*), and slash(/), respectively. Also, declaration of Boolean variables often implies using comparison operators: greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equals to (>=), less than or equals to (<=), etc. There are also equality operators falling into the same group. To test if two values are equal, use the double sign (==). For the inequality, use either '!=' or '<>' signs. Here is an example script for using equality/inequality operators: Variables b and c are identical: they will both have values of 0 for bars closing at the Open price (sometimes called candles) and 1 for the rest; values of variable a will be vice versa. The full list of comparison operators can be found ; don't be surprised when you see that thinkScript® accepts some English words as operators, this will be thoroughly explained in . For more complex calculations you might need some of thinkScript® functions. Let's start with power-related ones. These functions allow you to raise a value to a power, or find an exponential value or a logarithm.  Study the following script: This script calculates six data values based on the initial value of the Close to Open ratio for each bar. calculates the square of this value with . returns the square root using function. uses function to raise the value to the power of 3. calls the to raise Euler's number to the power of the value. returns the common logarithm of the value and , the natural logarithm; functions and are used for these purposes, respectively. Let's study the syntax of calling functions in thinkScript®: first, you type the name of the function, then you specify its arguments in parentheses and terminate the line with semicolon. If a function requires several arguments, they need to be separated with a comma – see how it works with variable in the example above. Function requires two arguments: value to be raised (in our case, it is variable ) and the power to raise this value to (we used 3 in the example). When working with power-related functions, you might want to use the Euler's number. There is a built-in constant in thinkScript® for this purpose: .

    {"title": "Chapter 12.  Past/Future Offset and Prefetch", "content": "When referencing historical data (described in ), you should keep in mind a feature called past offset. Let's study the following example. This example script will plot the Close price five bars prior to the current bar. This calculation mechanism is obvious for bars from the sixth through the last one, but how exactly this plot is going to be calculated for the first five bars? Past offset is a number of additional bars from the past, necessary for calculating a study. In this very example, the past offset is equal to five; it means that the calculation will start with the sixth bar using price data obtained from the first five bars. However, if additional historical data is available for the chart you are currently using, it will be used for calculating the plot for the first five bars. When scripting a study, you might need to use several different past offsets for expressions in your script. Let's analyze the following example: In this script, variable uses a past offset equal to 1, while function uses a past offset equal to 10. In thinkScript®, the highest past offset overrides lower offsets in the same study, which means that all expressions in a single study will have the same (highest) past offset. In the example script, this offset is equal to 10 and is assigned to both expressions. This is why the myline plot will return 11 for the first bar, not 2 as one might have expected. Note that past offset might affect calculation mechanism of some studies due to setting a single intialization point for all expressions. However, if for some reason you need an independent initialization point for an expression, you can use the function that you are already familiar with: This would explicitly set the value for the plot for the first bar, and all other values of this plot will be calculated corresponding to it. Prefetch is a property characteristic of Exponential Moving Averages that consists in fetching historical data prior to beginning of time period. This property enables these functions to be range independent. Three thinkScript® functions use prefetch: , , and . The number of bars needed for each of these to become range-independent can be calculated as follows: Note that also uses a past offset which is equal to bars; two others have a zero past offset. There is a notable difference between the past offset and prefetch: when historical data is not available, functions that only use prefetch will have the first bar on chart as an initialization point, while functions using past offset will be initialized at a bar whose number is equal to the past offset value. Unlike the two previously described features, future offset affects re-calculation of values for the most recent bars. When the future offset is equal to zero, e.g., in the only value that has to be re-calculated is that of the last bar on chart. However, if we specify a future offset in this expression using a negative index: the study will wait for a new quote in order to calculate the value for the second latest bar. Basically, this script plots the close price of the next bar as soon as there is a quote for it. Some functions use the future offset (and increase its value for the whole script) without waiting for the upcoming quotes. These functions produce values based on events, e.g., conference calls or earnings, scheduled for a future date.  To see how it works, refer, for example, to the function article. Apart from its influence on recent values, future offset can be useful in a number of specific tasks. For example, it is widely employed to indicate the level of the last close price across several most recent bars: This script records the last close price and plots it as a line across the last 4 bars, the number being customizable via the input parameter. In case you’re wondering what those and ! are, refer to the . Here, these constants are used for finding the last bar on chart. We strongly recommend that you use the “IsNaN + future offset” method for detection of the last bar, not the popular HighestAll method: The script above makes the study dependent on all bars of chart, which may result in productivity problems. Besides, the re-calculation mode will be set to once per bar instead of once per quote, which may also affect the output in an unwanted way. Should you need to fix the last bar in your script, use the future offset version: Three last chapters only covered time referencing: finding historical values, using secondary aggregation, or using additional bars from the past.

Time charts represent price action in terms of time: a new bar (or candlestick, line section, etc.) is plotted after completion of a certain time period (called aggregation period). For example, the 1y D bar chart plots the price action for one year, marking Open, High, Low, and Close prices on the daily basis. Tick charts represent intraday price action in terms of quantity of trades: a new bar (or candlestick, line section, etc.) is plotted after completion of a certain number of trades (ticks). This aggregation type can be used on intraday charts with time interval not greater than five days. For example, the 2d 133t bar chart plots the price action for two days, defining Open, High, Low, and Close prices every time the number of trades becomes equal to 133. Range charts represent price action in terms of price accumulation. Three modes of range aggregation are available in TOS Charts: Range Bars, Momentum Bars, and Renko Bars. However, these are not the subject of this chapter as we are going to discuss time aggregation in thinkScript® (information on range charts is available ). All scripts we created before were the ones using aggregation period defined in chart settings. In order to access data of a different aggregation period in your code, specify the period parameter using the corresponding constant. You can also use a pre-defined string value for this purpose: or . Here is an example script: This script plots daily Open price for the current symbol. This code plots weekly Close price for IBM. Interesting thing is that the IBM chart does not have to be opened to plot the Close price: it will be plotted on chart of any symbol you specified in chart settings. There is, however, a restriction in terms of time aggregation:  secondary aggregation period cannot be less than the primary aggregation period defined by chart settings: Designed to plot the High price reached on the previous day, this script will not work on weekly charts. Another restriction is that two different secondary aggregation periods cannot be used within a single variable: This script will not work on daily charts. In order to make it work, you need to break into two variables: When referencing secondary aggregation with a variable, keep in mind that if this variable is used in an expression with any of the or functions with the primary aggregation period, the whole expression will use the latter, not the secondary one. E.g., Here, SecondaryAvg is calculated with secondary aggregation period, but both PrimaryAvg1 and PrimaryAvg2 with primary aggregation period. Note also that some functions, e.g., use fundamental data implicitly, therefore, the same algorithm will be applied to expressions with them. Expressions that use a variable referencing secondary aggregation and constant values will keep the secondary aggregation period: The plot will be calculated as a 12 SMA of the Close price plus 10. By now, a lot of thinkScript® features have been explained to you. We are sure you will have absolutely no problems with reading this script: This script is based on the study but price inputs were substituted by constant input, new constant input was added, and old price input references were replaced with function calls. This approach can be used to rewrite predefined studies to add support of secondary aggregation period.

The type of securities and investment strategies mentioned may not be suitable for everyone. Each investor needs to review a security transaction for his or her own particular situation. Market volatility, volume and system availability may delay account access and trade executions. Investing involves risk including loss of principal.
